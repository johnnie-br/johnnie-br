Hello, I'm @johnnie_br, I'm a 3d designer, beginner in 3d animations and audio editing. I like modifying games, especially GTA, and I do it all as a hobby. My first language is Portuguese, but I can communicate in English and I understand very little Spanish and Italian... Latin language things.

You can see more of me in my Link tree: https://linktr.ee/johnnie.br
